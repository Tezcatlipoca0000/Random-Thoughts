          If society doesn't give a crap about me, why should I care about society? I bet many people feel this way about society at some point in their lives; especially because every human is only looking after themselves, and capitalism encourages individualism and competition. Even so, I leave you here not a "work in progress" rather my ignorance at a certain point of my existence, on display for you to take whatever you want, just be careful not to get poisoned.
          I'm Tezcatlipoca, the creator of this page and its content, in this space I have the audacity of writing some of my thoughts and opinions that transit my conscious mind from time to time; I don't pretend, however, to claim originality on any of the ideas expressed here. <q>There´s nothing I can say that hasn't been said before</q> <sup>(source: I think Montaigne)</sup>, <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes_1">there is nothing new under the sun</q><sup>(<cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes_1" target="_blank">Wiki Link</a></cite>)</sup>
          Specifically I want to write about the effects that capitalism and other social institutions have on the human mind.
          At the end of this pamphlet, on the footer, I will leave my E-mail address and I will count myself lucky if anyone decides to share with me their ideas.

  				I don't believe economy, in general terms, is very fair to the majority. That's my postulate for this topic. <br>
  				It's pretty easy to imagine things from a position of ignorance, and yes I don't know anything about economy, but I still feel convinced about my initial postulate; Let me rephrase it: "Capitalism is not very fair to the majority." - Not that I think that communism is any better. <br>
  				What bugs me the most is that our economy system interferes with our self-preservation notions (which affects us in many ways). The majority of us is given only two options: either you work, pretty much like a slave, in terms of how many time you've to spend working and the benefits you obtain, or you starve, and nobody gives a crap about starving people, well mostly anybody. <br>
  				Self-preservation is a strong force within us, capable of making us change, sometimes in ways we never imagined. Most people think they're in control of themselves, and while that's somewhat true (let's say 10% true) it's also oh so not true. Self-preservation is one of those forces within us that's capable of overriding most, if not all, of the ego's ordinances but it's not limited to the ego, every other force (e.g. sexuality, moral, intelligence, indoctrination, etc.) also has the potential of being affected by the all-mighty self-preservation force. <br> 
          When our self-preservation kicks in, be it because we're in current danger or maybe because we're taking an important decision that will affect our capabilities to live better or worse for our near or distant future, when it kicks in, I mean, we become more animals and less humans. Almost anyone (very few people will put ethics above their interests less alone above their self-preservation), when faced with the choice of earning more money at the expense of doing something slightly unethical, most people will choose the unethical path because earning more money means, not only living better, but also, in part, securing our future, our self-preservation. <br>
  				I'm just questioning the idea... Is competitiveness against our fellow species and individualism the correct path to produce resources? Is starvation really necessary for society to function correctly, is poverty needed, do we really have to distribute world's wealth like we're doing right now? I speak from what I see, so I might be totally wrong here, but I think there are more people that have to spend their lives working than people that can spend their lives living. I see the necessary people for a company to function correctly living 'barely' and a very few 'lucky' people that don't work living in opulence. Is threatening everybody with starvation the best way to make the humans produce? Maybe, just maybe, our economic system don't have the correct appreciation of the human soul; maybe enforcing production the way it's done is not as effective.<br>
  				I'm not asking to get everything for nothing, I'm not talking about having your self-preservation means secured for free. I do believe in working your weight in society, I'm just questioning the amount needed to invest. Is the amount worked being paid fairly? Is wealth distributed fairly among society?<br>
  				I'm sure things differ from country to country and even from city to city, but in a global scale, do workers have time for themselves? I mean to nourish themselves, not just to cover basic necessities, are people being educated to be something else than a good slave? <br>
          I believe a good understanding of the human "soul" is needed in order to create a 'fair' and 'productive' system. I also believe that a good investment on a human will yield good results; I don't think it's necessary to threaten everyone with starvation, exposure and discrimination for them to give something back to society, I believe everyone has 'something' that could turn to be productive, the thing is, why would anybody share what they have willingly in a competitive, individualistic and aggressive environment?

          <code><q cite="Aristotle. Nicomachean Ethics. book 1. Chapter 1">A first point, that should be evident, is that 'good' derives from the sovereign science, the most fundamental science of all; and it's precisely the political science. It is, in fact, the one that determines which are the sciences indispensable for the existence of the States, which are the ones citizens must learn, and until what degree they must possess them. Besides, it's important to observe, that the most cherished sciences are subordinated to the political; I mean, military science, administrative science and rhetoric. As it uses all practical sciences and prescribes also in the name of the law what must be done and what must be avoided, you might say, that it's goal includes the goal of every other science; and, thus, politics would be the true 'good', the supreme 'good' of man.</q></code><sup>(<cite>Aristotle. Nicomachean Ethics. Book 1. Chapter 1</cite>)</sup><br>
          Ancient Greeks had so beautiful ideas of what politics and good governments should look like; today's governments around the globe, most of them anyways, are a real shame. It seem to me that maintaining the status quo has become the only main thing governments do this days; most of them have become experts fabricating news and molding people perceptions into making them more obedient; making virtuous citizens is the least of their concerns. In fact individualism and competition has created corruption in every level of the government system almost, if not so, worldwide. And having under-educated citizens makes it easier to making them subservient and compulsive. <br>
          Check this page out to see how widespread corruption is: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/corruption" target="_blank">ourworldindata.org</a> <br>
          The democratic system as well is in need of revision. I feel confident that we, intellectual species, can do better than: "the majority rules", I mean reality is usually a little bit more complex than that, and to think that the majority is always correct sounds frankly stupid. The majority is not always correct, in fact many, many times the majority is wrong. And to make things worse we try to 'simplify' things and avoid giving each vote a different value, when it's obvious that, depending on the reason, each vote should 'weight' differently; for instance, if you know that this vote was casted the way it was because someone gave him some things (maybe a gift basket with a lot of products with ads) in exchange for that vote, you might be inclined to value it a little bit less than a vote casted that or the other way but with reasonable arguments, especially those that takes in consideration the benefit of the majority. Anyhow, I don't know much about politics either, I think it would be easy to imagine a system that's, at least, a little bit more fair to the majority; but what do I know, I'm sure it's not because of corruption and an opportunity to gain individual gain that keeps us in this system; it's probably for the best, right?

          Let me talk about some major lack of ethics in our society. No surprise here that the least ethic actions humans do are made by inhuman imaginary entities called corporations; through corporations humans use the anonymity disguise to carry on the most unethical desires of their masters, the corporation owners. I didn't mean to generalize, let's try to talk about singular cases instead: <br>
          <ul>
            <li>How about all the crap in the food industry, that most people end up eating, that is there because there's a lot of economic interest for the parties involved (both in the government and the food industries).</li>
            <li>Or programmed obsolescence: what a good way to keep general population as slaves and poor as poor, all while the powerful and rich get more powerful and more rich (Obviously because things broke down faster forcing the population to spend more).</li>
            <li>How about the energy industry! Another huge stupidity that we slaves tolerate, (in part because we don't have the education) that is maintained despite all the evident damage done to everything involving it, especially because there are many alternative energy sources known to humans that we could use and develop, but we choose not to</li>
            <li>I believe the amount of ads is dangerously high and the veracity of their messages is ridiculous, people are literally being mind-washed on a massive scale to adopt a more expensive life style or to adopt a more compliant personality that doesn't questions the system.</li> 
            <li>There's also some companies that buy garbage to countries just to dump the garbage into the ocean; the lack of environmental consciousness is also a big lack of ethics that many have. </li>
            <li>Within every profession there's also the possibility of corruption. Doctors are the same as mechanics, most of them want to sell you more than you actually need.</li>

          Education is one the most prolific tool humans have developed, through it, and it alone, humans have the chance of taming their inner animal and become a more humanitarian human, one more rational, possibly more intelligent, and with that, probably less impulsive. <br> 
          It seems to me that in most countries, if not all, the goal of the educational system is to transform human animals into good slaves: people who will repress their own aggressiveness, will know how to make this or that, but one that definitely don't need to know anything about him/herself, nor the past. Generally the little knowledge given about the past is usually handpicked historical events, frequently tales of patriotism (sometimes even invented stories). Of course they're not going to tell you how the last president stole that much amount of money or what not.<br>
          Education of a human should include: knowing yourself, knowing the past and knowing the cosmos. Humans who don't are likely to be more gullible, more compulsive, more subservient, don't have a strong moral or have double standards, be more neurotic, which translates into having a more unsatisfactory life, be more individualistic and, generally, less intelligent; It tends to create many 'false' systems of believe (superstitions) or to hold tight to whatever system they inherit (fanaticism), it doesn't help you question and makes people believe they don't need to conduct their lives with reason, most people just conduct their lives compulsively without taking control of themselves, they seem to always be 'acting' for the love of others and they never take a rational decision only emotional ones; it seems to me the 'rational' speech is disappearing from the face of the earth, is 'fashion' the only thing in the human mind?.<br>
          Knowing yourself will help you commit less errors by compulsion and by narcissism; knowing your past will make you wise; and knowing the cosmos will make you intelligent. I believe every human could profit from this knowledge.<br>
          In reality, I perceive that the education is focusing more in transforming the human animal into a human capable of socializing with some knowledge of the cosmos to make him productive, and in it's intent of transforming him, it seems to me, they try to 'protect/hide/manage' him/her from the truth; most of the people prefer to lie to a kid than to explain the horrible world we live in, sometimes they try to justify their lying by saying something about 'preserving something magical or good inside of them' and they try to do so by lying and hiding information. I believe that's a huge mistake many partake. We shouldn't lie about the shit we're in, not to anyone, and especially not to a kid. Pretending we're perfect just stagnates the human development, instead give the kid a good view of what's wrong and he'll probably try to help, and with enough time, he/she probably could. Insisting in conserving the 'magical thought' and religion in that matter, affects the correct development of the human mind and hinders intelligence.

          To try to achieve a complete and comprehensible understanding of the human mind and capabilities would be an enormous task that would deviate from the purposes of this little pamphlet. All I want to remark here is: every human action has the intention of producing pleasure or alleviating pain, so every human action has, to say the least, a selfish component that's meant to pleasure. <q cite="Cicerón, El bien y el mal supremos, I, 13, 42">Don't matter what anyone says, even in virtue everyone's final goal is pleasure. <!--Digan lo que digan, incluso en la virtud el objetivo último al que nos dirigimos es el placer.--></q><sup>(My own translation from: <cite>Cicerón, El bien y el mal supremos, I, 13, 42</cite>)</sup> <br>
          Because of that fact every human often lies to themselves and to others, to avoid recognizing hurtful truths they project to the exterior their own faults and believe the lies they tell themselves to make reality a little more bearable; <br>
          I had a teacher who often said <q>The ego is a dirty corrupt</q>, and I've learned to believe him. The human mind is not a single unity/entity/organization, it's more like clusters, like galaxies in the universe, you have really big, organized structures, and some very dispersed small constellations, or single objects flying about. And everything has its set of rules that govern every action, movement or phenomenon. Learning those set of rules is a key piece to understanding ourselves; knowing that a part of the ego, for the possibility of pleasure, can: forget things, make mistakes, change a memory and even change perception itself, and all this against another of the ego's part, is important. Being able to recognize our narcissism or a compulsive act can help us be more rational and commit less logical mistakes. <br>
          The human mind is complex, but like everything else in this universe, it's determined by laws. There's no psychological phenomenon that can exist without a reason. That only means there's really no free will; we are very little different from a rock. When I throw a rock this one can only land in one place, depending on certain variables in play (e.g. the force, weight, resistance, etc.), I might not know all the variables, and might not be able to calculate the exact spot where it will land but it still is determined; and the same goes for every psychological phenomenon, I mean, every thought, feeling, impulse, idea, or whatever, everything is determined by strict laws. Free will is an illusion; we 'feel' we're in control but we're actually just 'rolling downhill'. We're very similar to computers in some ways, some of the variables that determine us are 'inscribed in our hardware', I mean the body itself, and some other variables that affect the outcome are inscribed in our life experiences. New information can make the output somewhat different, depending on the information I feed the human mind. Among the variables that come given with the human body are those that make the subject more aggressive or more sexual, more or less intelligent, more or less clever, more or less perceptive, etc. are usually part of that which we refer to as the character and innate gifts/abilities. Regardless of the variables that come given in the human body, every ability, virtue or behavior can be taught, trained and developed if given the correct life experiences or information.

          {Nietzche tenía razón cuando decía que no se puede borrar del alma lo que tus antepasados hicieron de la manera más gustosa y repetitiva y por eso es que para conocerse a sí mismo es necesario tener conocimientos sobre tus antepasados y tu propio pasado; para conocerse a sí mismo también es necesario tener conocimientos del funcionamiento general del aparato psíquico y, por último, conocimientos específicos de tu aparato psíquico y motor. Es decir, para conocerse propiamente uno tiene que saber de dónde viene, cómo 'funcionan' los humanos en términos generales y cómo funcionas tú en particular. Saber tú pasado, por una parte, y tus gustos, inclinaciones y limitaciones, por la otra, es una tarea personal que no puede ser aprendida más que mediante tu propio esfuerzo, por lo que me centraré en escribir sobre la otra parte de conocerse a sí mismo, me refiero al conocimiento general sobre el ser humano. Con ello me refiero a conocimiento técnico sobre el funcionamiento general del aparato psíquico y del cuerpo humano. Creo que es una parte subestimada pero sumamente importante. 

          En términos generales, el aparato psíquico de los seres humanos se puede apreciar como un aparato que se compone de diversas instancias y que funcionan según ciertas reglas generales. 

          Las instancias principales que conforman el aparato psíquico, según mi modo poético de decir las cosas, son: "el animal" "la sociedad" y "el esclavo" (quizá ahí donde Freud diría "Ello", "Superyó" y "Yo" respectivamente). "El animal" es esa parte de nosotros que viene dada desde el nacimiento, es la parte más elemental y básica del aparato psíquico y como tal también la podemos encontrar en otros animales además del ser humano, y principalmente conforma los impulsos agresivos y sexuales, es totalmente egoísta y narcisista. Con "la sociedad" me refiero a esa parte interiorizada en vida y pasada de generación en generación; quiero decir, se obtiene de manera filogenética a traves de las generaciones y se manifiesta en forma de impulsos, y se obtiene también de manera ontogénica y se manifiesta como impulso o como un razonamiento en la conciencia con uso de los signos del lenguaje; su origen viene dado de la instancia "animal" que fue modificada por la realidad de vivir en sociedad, por lo tanto también podemos decir que es "el animal domesticado" o "el animal atemorizado", por lo tanto sus impulsos tienen el objetivo facilitar la vida en sociedad. "El esclavo" es lo que me parece define mejor a esa instancia que se encuentra más cercana a la conciencia, de hecho su origen también viene de la instancia "animal" así que también podemos decir que es "el animal que tiene que actuar rápido" es esa parte del "animal" que fue modificada por la experiencia, por los golpes de la vida, esta, por lo tanto, afinada para lidiar con las exigencias de la realidad; la labor principal de esta instancia es "equilibrar" los imperiosos reclamos de las otras instancias y hacerlo de una menra que sea posible en la realidad. Las otras dos instancias son "impositivas", quiero decir mandan/comunican sus impulsos/deseos no necesariamente usando signos de lenguaje pero siempre acompañadas de signos de placer o displacer; mientras que "el esclavo" tiene la labor de guiar la motricidad o la atención para la satisfacción de las otras instancias siguiendo los signos de placer-displacer. El yo/esclavo NO desarrolla por si mismo pensamientos, sentimientos, deseos o impulsos; todo parte de las otras instancias, el yo solamente toma la información que llega a la conciencia e intenta organizarla para la acción específica que va a producir placer o evitar displacer, en ocasiones de manera lógica y congruente usando el lenguaje, pero puede suceder también que el yo "no encuentre palabras" y entonces queda un sentimiento indefinido o una reacción acorde al fin. El acto de organizar la información y atravesarla con los signos del lenguaje ya en sí genera información, por ejemplo cuando llegan a la conciencia al mismo tiempo impulsos contrarios provenientes de las otras dos instancias, el yo probablemente intentará darle algún sentido y le asignará signos de lenguaje a ambas sensasiones y tendrá la tarea de "pesar" ambos impulsos, es decir, valorarlos y determinar el camino que implique menos displacer y más placer, quizá eso abra el camino hacia algunos recuerdos o active algunas reacciones previamente desarrolladas durante la vida del sujeto, desarrollos estos que se representarán en la conciencia "afectando" así de regreso a las otras instancias, probablemente despues de algun tiempo de "comunicación/retroalimentación", el yo <em>encontrará</em> la forma de balancear los impulsos contrarios y de darle un sentido. De esta retroalimentación al yo sólo le resta la sensación de haber "decidido", él solo, cómo usar su tiempo y qué le genera más placer; sin embargo el yo sólo es capaz, a veces, de entender qué es lo que atraviesa la conciencia. "El yo" es pues un esclavo <br>
          De esta manera los he conducido a algo que quiero decirles: el libre albedrio no existe; no somos muy diferentes de un objeto inanimado, toda la materia en este universo sólo obedece leyes muy precisas que determinan toda su trayectoria; "el aparato psíquico" es un modelo teórico que nos permite representar el complejo funcionamiento del cuerpo humano. Admito que no tengo idea de cómo responder a las interrogantes sobre el principio del universo, pero desde su comienzo todo en ello actúa de manera muy consistente, ya sea que sepamos las leyes que lo rigen o no. Aquí sería interesante introducir la física cuántica y los problemas que representa; Sin embargo debo disculparme de antemano por mi ignorancia y la respuesta rápida que propongo: Yo me inclino a imaginar que la materia de dimensiones cuánticas también se rige por leyes que solamente no hemos descubierto y que nuestros medios de observación afectan a dicha materia de manera que no imaginamos. <br>
          Entiendo que mi decisión de no detenerme mucho tiempo en bascilar sobre el inicio del universo y mi decisión de aceptar como verdadera mi suposición antes mencionada sobre los problemas presentados en la física cuántica son caprichosos; no les ofrezco ningún remedio ni consuelo ante ello. seguiré adelante. <br> 

          Todas las instancias psíquicas deben someterse a la regla principal que rige el sistema psíquico y está regla se puede resumir bajo el nombre de "principio de placer": todo lo que el ser humano busca es obtener placer y evitar el displacer y toda acción o fenómeno psíquico lleva este objetivo. }
          {el intelecto es algo que atraviesa las diferentes instancias del aparato psíquico, utiliza las representaciones existentes en el aparato sin importar dónde o en que estado se encuentren, no es una facultad exclusiva del yo o siquiera una que el yo pueda "utilizar"; los animales pueden ser inteligentes, una reacción puede serlo también, }
          {El ser humano no deja de ser un animal (aunque algunos humanos son más animales que otros) y como tal su aparato psíquico comporta varias semejanzas con otros animales. Entre las semejanzas más importantes encontramos "el imperio del placer": Todo organismo busca evitar el displacer y procurarse placer. no hay animal, impulso, pensamiento o sentimiento que escape a este imperioso orden. Aun cuando creemos que nuetro acto denota altruismo no deja de haber un componente egoísta en cada acción humana. El ser humano es antes de cualquier otra cosa un animal. También puedo decir: dentro de cualquier ser humano habita un animal; es esa parte de nosotros que no conoce moral alguna; esa parte de nuestro aparato psíquico que viene dada con la biología desde el momento en que nacemos.   }

          Morale structures rises from a particular time and social need; therefore there is and has been many moral structures throughout the history of the human civilization. It exist to enable humans to live in a society; without it there cannot be a civilization. It changes from region to region and from time to time, but there are immutable laws that has never changed since the beginning of society, such as those that prevent endogamy and murder, these laws are the most important for the development of a civilization, thus every civilization has imposed them in their own way, now those laws, over the centuries of indoctrination, have become taboo. <br>
          Just like civilizations have different morale structures so do individuals, most of the persons just 'inherit' their morale, copy and repeat from what they see, but usually never question or dedicate time, attention and effort into reaching a reasonable decision; morale is a fashion, todays morale says: <q>If you don't have money you're not important</q>, like if humans weren't the most valuable resource on earth.

          The knowledge about the past is as important as the knowledge about our nature, to know about the cosmos past gives perspective and, maybe-hopefully humility, to know the past of your species gives you another advantage that is a practical wisdom. It's been proven that information passes from generation to generation in the animal kingdom, but the gift of the written language has exploited that ability a thousand fold, being able to gain the cumulative knowledge of people who dedicated their lives to study a corner of the cosmos, for example, is an unprecedented advantage to a species; and that's without mentioning the, somewhat new, ability to send information at the speed of light (mind-blowing!). I'm confident the free access to information is key for humans to develop their potential. Therefore the knowledge about the past, in general terms, is an advantage to humans that shouldn't be underestimated. <br>
          Among the information I consider important about this subject would be: the information about the past of the cosmos, in general terms; the information about the past of the species, in general terms; information about early civilizations, early philosophers and early religions, in general terms; information about philosophy, in detail; information about civilizations and their conflicts of each period of history, in detail. 
          It's important to try to understand our species through our past act, the heroic and the inhumane. Trying to hide the ugliness of our nature will not help us, quite the opposite.

          There are, unfortunately, many poor <s>apes</s>, I mean humans, who still believe in some sort of deity. The best way to unlearn all the lies religions have said throughout the times is to learn the history of those same religions. When you have, on one hand, some knowledge of the human mind's capabilities (e.g. that it's main goal is pleasure, that it can project, create memories, change perceptions by hallucinating, etc.), and on the other hand, the knowledge of how religions have said so many lies, have been mistaken on some many matters and are the responsible ones for so many dead and atrocities; when you have that knowledge, the idea of a deity seems more like a human invention. Maybe a way to avoid the uncertainty (which was unpleasant), a way to avoid the truth (which is unpleasant) or maybe just a way to control and convince other humans into giving their money of fighting for me (which could be pleasant); I don't know but after all they have said and done it's impossible to thrust in their preaching.<br>
          It all begins with one question that can be formulated differently but mean pretty much the same thing: How/why do we/everything-else exists? Sure thing nobody today knows the answer, but far too many <strong>assure</strong> the reason is that a 'will', with pretty much the same range of human emotions (e.g. wrath, anger, love, etc.), and usually a human form with an immense interest in the human kind, created the lot, and they <strong>assure</strong> that. With no proof whatsoever other that the passing of information from generation to generation since a few thousands of years old. Now, since there's absolutely no evidence in favor on that theory it's best not to submerge into the subject directly, because one might get lost in all the lies and fantasies, especially if the person in question doesn't have knowledge about him/herself and the cosmos. The proper way to appreciate how unlikely is the theory of a 'will', that loves us all or some of the humans but hate the others, is to have knowledge about the past of the human civilizations in general, and knowledge of the human mind. Maybe that's why we have seen and see very intelligent persons who, despite that, believe in god; they're very intelligent in certain subjects but probably lack one or both of the information required to get a proper perspective of the matter: information about the human soul, and information about the past of the religious institutions.<br>
          To many, I can understand, it would result painful and difficult to accept this notion, and therefore would try to do what any other human/animal is determined to do, depending on many things actually, one might try to reaffirm him/herself on whatever believes they had/have (e.g. <q>There has to be someone that created everything</q> no there mustn’t be! Who told you that?), other would lash out in aggression towards the idea (e.g. maybe calling it stupid), but without reasoning as to why, many emotional responses could be given, one maybe stopped reading one paragraph ago. But all the lies, inaccuracies, contradictions and inhuman behavior leave no room to believe in any of the religious propositions.<br>

          <code><q cite="Voltaire. Tratado sobre la tolerancia">Reason, slow but infallibly, lights man</q></code> <sup>(My own translation from: <cite>Voltaire.

          It's very easy to a human to believe what your authority is saying, or to follow and repeat what the majority is doing, but it's our duty to fight our own feelings and our own automatic-unreasonable actions if these are obstructing us from a rational and veridical information or action. Fighting your own narcissism and compulsiveness and, sometimes, unlearning big chunks of indoctrination if reason demands it, is conducting ourselves, or at least trying to which is better than nothing, conduct ourselves using the greatest advantage nature has given us. It's about being intelligent for the common good of the species, not just for an individualistic and immediate gain.

          {Creo que el sistema ecónomico actual beneficia a una minoría que se aprovecha, mediante explotación, del trabajo de la mayoría; creo que el sistema educativo, politico, económico y moral están construidos para el mantenimiento de dicho sistema; Creo, pues, que la mayoría está 'programada' para ser buenos esclavos, lo noto principalmente en lo generalizado y aceptado que es la discriminación por clasismo, la mayoría de la gente considera que es lo más correcto trabajar y recibir una mínima fracción de lo que produce (o por lo menos no lo cuestiona), la mayoría de la gente tiene una diminuta porcion de conocimiento especializado en una tarea que el empleado repite por la mayor porción de su vida, es decir, carece de los conocimientos sobre si mismo y sobre su pasado.}
          {Es demasiado fuerte la tradición-compulsión de aceptar el destino de trabajar como esclavos. }
          {Dice Voltaire: "El gran medio de disminuir el número de maniáticos, si quedan, es someter esta enfermedad del espíritu al régimen de la razón, que lenta, pero infaliblemente, ilumina a los hombres. Esta razón es dulce, es humana, inspira indulgencia, ahoga la discordia, fortalece la virtud, hace amable la obediencia o las leyes, mucho más de lo que la fuerza las impone." }
          {En otros tiempos el simio ha cometido actos que el día de hoy reconocemos como atroces, sin embargo en su tiempo fueron acceptados y comunes; las personas en ese momento no se sublevavan en contra de los dogmas establecidos y quienes lo hacían eran reprendido. Yo quiero señalarles las atrocidades que tomamos como normales y aceptamos comunmente el día de hoy, pero que quizá en un futuro queden proscritas: principalmente me refiero a la discriminación económica. }
          {¡Indolentes! Qué? no les importa nada la vida de los pobres? Estamos tan habituados a la discriminación clasista que miramos con desprecio al artista, maldecimos al pordiosero y agradecemos al gobierno por la violencia con la que trata a los criminales. El sistema recompensa la falta de moral y mientras así siga siendo el efecto que ello tendrá en la psique será el mismo: sistemas sin moral, que luchan individualistamente entre ellos. ¿Será esa la única forma de organizarnos? }
          {Un buen amigo con dotes en el arte de la psicoterapia me decía con regularidad que las personas no quieren que les digas en qué están equivocados, desafortunada característica que presenta la aplastante mayoría de las personas y que dificulta la labor de cualquiera que se dedique a ello.  }
          {Al leer la obra de Sigmund Freud quede convencido de una cosa en particular: los fenómenos psíquicos están determinados por la biología o por las experiencias de vida; tanto los sueños, como los lapsus, los olvidos, los errores, cuanto con mayor razón las constelaciones y estructuras psíquicas: Freud nunca lo dijo con estas palabras pero es lo bastante obvio: <em>Todos los fenómenos psíquicos están determinados</em>; por lo tanto: <em>No existe el libre albedrio.</em> La voluntad es una ilusión de la cual todos participamos  }
          {Todos los humanos son animales pero "algunos son más animales que otros"; si el homo-sapiens se distingue del resto de las formas de vida es por su sapiencia, es decir su inteligencia, y los animales se distinguen por su sometimiento al principio de placer, es decir, la facilidad con la que recurren a la violencia y en general la falta de inteligencia; por lo tanto el humano más animal será el que use menos la inteligencia y se someta más a sus impulsos que el resto. Durante muchos años vivimos de manera "animal" hasta que las primeras sociedades se comenzaron a formar; es seguro afirmar que la sociedad es la más grande ventaja que tiene el humano, y los factores que determinaron y mantienen a la sociedad con vida se conoce como "moral". De tal manera, parece evidente, que es inteligente vivir en sociedad y tener una moral para el ser humano. Entonces ¿Por que mantener un sistema que recompensa la agresividad, impulsividad, falta de ética y en general, la falta de moral? Los efectos del capitalismo en la psique humana promueven el individualismo, el egoísmo y la agresividad y violencia.}

           The legal system is another example of a behavior that persist for compulsion/tradition/economical-interest. I find the idea of 'finding a guilty person' a lack of intelligence. 
           If we can agree our behavior is determined then we can also think everybody behaves the way they do for a reason. People steal because our government steals, or because they're hungry, or because they lacked a good education, but most probably, people's behavior is determined by a multitude of reasons, not just one. If instead of 'punishing' an individual we would evaluate where and how can we make that individual be productive in society we could all benefit instead of losing/wasting resources. It's easier to focus all of your attention and anger and guilt into one person instead of really trying to understand the reality we're living in. The system we've imposed on ourselves is barbaric and stupid and maintained only for the lack of education on the majority and the advantages the persons in power perceive. The system is unfair, makes us compete against each other, rewards the lack of ethics, threaten us with starvation the whole time, doesn't facilitate us the education we need, but it does facilitate any message (even lies) if you pay to play repeat. Most people believe is a 'fair' thing to claim for blood in a trial. And what happened to the Calas family happens today everyday! The crowd yelling makes the verdict.
